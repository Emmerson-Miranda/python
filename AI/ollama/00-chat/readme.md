A week has 7 days because the Babylonians, who developed the seven-day cycle, believed that each day was ruled by a different planet or celestial body. They divided the circle of the zodiac into seven segments, with each segment representing a day and a corresponding planet (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn). This 7-day cycle was later adopted by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and eventually became the standard for modern calendars.

The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths by the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere, such as nitrogen and oxygen. This scattering effect gives our sky its blue hue!

# setup.py

The setup.py script builds your code into a distribution. It looks for packages inside the root folder, 
so it must be in the root folder. 

Notice that inside the root folder there is a folder with the exact same name as the root folder, my_package. 
In this way you make sure setup.py will find a package with the name my_package.

# Development mode

To install in development mode open terminal and type "pip install -e <path\to\package>". 
If in terminal you are in the packageâ€™s directory you can type: "pip install -e ."

Output:
```
my_package % pip install -e .

A question that has puzzled people for centuries!

The reason we have a seven-day week is rooted in ancient Babylonian and Sumerian cultures. The Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), are believed to have developed the seven-day week around 2000 BCE.

At that time, the Babylonians used a lunisolar calendar, which was based on the cycles of the moon and the sun. They divided their month into four weeks, with each week corresponding to a particular phase of the moon. This system is thought to have been influenced by the Sumerians, who also used a lunisolar calendar.

The Babylonians then assigned names to each day of the week based on the seven celestial bodies they believed controlled the universe:

1. Sunday (or "Sun Day") - named after the sun
2. Monday (or "Moon Day") - named after the moon
3. Tuesday - named after Tiw, a god associated with war and law
4. Wednesday - named after Woden, a god associated with wisdom and poetry
5. Thursday - named after Thor, a god associated with thunder
6. Friday - named after Frigg, a goddess associated with love and beauty
7. Saturday - named after Saturn (or "Shabbat" in Hebrew), the Roman god of agriculture and time

These names were later adopted by the Romans, who modified them to create the modern seven-day week we use today.

Interestingly, other cultures have used different numbers of days in their weeks throughout history. For example, the ancient Egyptians used a ten-day week, while the Mayans used a thirteen-day week. But the seven-day week has become the standard used globally, thanks to the Babylonian influence on Western culture.
